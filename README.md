## üéØ Overview

This project implements the complete Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch, without relying on any pre-built transformer libraries. The implementation serves as both an educational resource and a functional model that can be trained for various NLP tasks.

**Why implement from scratch?** Understanding the inner workings of transformers is crucial for anyone working in modern AI. This implementation provides clear, well-documented code that makes the complex mathematics and architecture accessible.

## üìö The Paper That Changed Everything

### "Attention Is All You Need" - A Revolution in AI

Published in 2017 by Google Research, this paper introduced the Transformer architecture that would become the foundation for virtually all modern large language models including GPT, BERT, T5, and ChatGPT.

#### What Made It Revolutionary?

1. **Eliminated Recurrence**: Unlike RNNs and LSTMs, Transformers process all tokens in parallel, dramatically improving training speed
2. **Pure Attention Mechanism**: Replaced convolutions and recurrence entirely with attention mechanisms
3. **Scalability**: The architecture scales beautifully with increased model size and data
4. **Transfer Learning**: Enabled the pre-train/fine-tune paradigm that dominates modern NLP

#### Key Innovation: Self-Attention

The core insight was that attention mechanisms alone, without recurrence or convolution, are sufficient for sequence modeling. The famous equation:

```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/‚àöd_k)V
```

This simple formula captures relationships between all positions in a sequence simultaneously, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input regardless of their distance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Transformer follows an encoder-decoder architecture, though this implementation focuses on the decoder-only variant (similar to GPT):

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to attend to different representation subspaces
2. **Positional Encoding**: Injects sequence order information using sinusoidal functions
3. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Point-wise fully connected layers with ReLU activation
4. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training and improves gradient flow
5. **Residual Connections**: Enables training of very deep networks

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
torch>=1.9.0
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathanCordeiro/Attention-Zero-To-One.git
cd Attention-Zero-To-One
pip install torch
```

### Quick Start

```python
import torch
from transformer_implementation import Transformer

# Initialize model
model = Transformer(
    vocab_size=10000,
    embed_dim=512,
    num_heads=8,
    num_layers=6,
    ff_dim=2048,
    max_seq_length=1024,
    dropout=0.1
)

# Example usage
input_ids = torch.randint(0, 10000, (1, 50))  # Batch size 1, sequence length 50
output = model(input_ids)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")  # [1, 50, 10000]
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Text Generation

```python
def generate_text(model, input_ids, max_length=100, temperature=1.0):
    model.eval()
    generated = input_ids.clone()
    
    for _ in range(max_length):
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model(generated)
            next_token_logits = outputs[0, -1, :] / temperature
            next_token = torch.multinomial(F.softmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1), 1)
            generated = torch.cat([generated, next_token.unsqueeze(0)], dim=1)
    
    return generated
```

### Training Loop

```python
def train_step(model, batch, optimizer, criterion):
    model.train()
    inputs, targets = batch
    
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs.view(-1, outputs.size(-1)), targets.view(-1))
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    return loss.item()
```

## üß† Key Learnings

### Mathematical Insights

1. **Attention as Soft Dictionary Lookup**: The attention mechanism can be viewed as a differentiable key-value store where queries retrieve weighted combinations of values
2. **Parallel Processing**: Unlike RNNs, all positions are processed simultaneously, enabling efficient GPU utilization
3. **Position Independence**: Self-attention is permutation invariant, requiring explicit positional encoding

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Memory Complexity**: Self-attention has O(n¬≤) memory complexity with sequence length
2. **Gradient Flow**: Proper residual connections and layer normalization are crucial for training deep networks
3. **Numerical Stability**: Careful scaling (dividing by ‚àöd_k) prevents softmax saturation

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Pre vs Post Layer Norm**: This implementation uses pre-norm for better gradient flow
2. **Causal Masking**: Essential for autoregressive language modeling
3. **Multi-Head Design**: Allows attending to different representation subspaces simultaneously

## üîç Technical Deep Dive

### Self-Attention Mathematics

The self-attention mechanism computes attention weights for each position with respect to all other positions:

1. **Linear Projections**: Transform input into Query, Key, Value matrices
2. **Attention Scores**: Compute similarity between queries and keys
3. **Softmax Normalization**: Convert scores to probability distribution
4. **Weighted Aggregation**: Combine values based on attention weights

### Positional Encoding

Uses sinusoidal functions to encode position information:
- Even dimensions: sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
- Odd dimensions: cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))

This allows the model to learn relative positions and potentially extrapolate to longer sequences.

### Multi-Head Attention Benefits

1. **Representation Diversity**: Different heads can focus on different types of relationships
2. **Parallel Computation**: Multiple attention patterns computed simultaneously
3. **Rich Interactions**: Captures both local and global dependencies

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Memory Optimization
- Use gradient checkpointing for very deep models
- Consider attention patterns for long sequences (sparse attention, sliding window)
- Batch size tuning based on available GPU memory

### Training Efficiency
- Learning rate scheduling (warmup + decay)
- Mixed precision training for faster computation
- Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients

### Inference Optimization
- KV-caching for autoregressive generation
- Model quantization for deployment
- ONNX export for production environments

## üîÆ Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements

   - Linear attention mechanisms
   - Sparse attention patterns
   - Flash Attention integration

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)
   - SwiGLU activation function
   - RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm

   - Gradient accumulation
   - Mixed precision support

4. **Model Variants**
